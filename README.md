Express.js Note-Taker

For this Application its supposed to be a note-taker that starts with the notes homepage. The user will then see a button to start and will got to the page with notes using routes. The page needs to have functionality to get all the notes, get a note by its Id, create a new note, or delete a note from the list of notes. The application does this using routes and functions that work with express.js going to the path from the port based on routes.
